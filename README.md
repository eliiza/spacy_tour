# A tour of awesome features of spaCy

This repo contains complementary jupyter notebooks for [part 1](sdf) and [part 2]() of a tour through features of spaCy, versatile and fast natural language processing library for python.  

In the first part we go through 
* preprocessing tasks: tokenisation, sentence segmentation, lemmatisation, stopwords, 
* linguistic features: pos tags, dependency parsing, named entity recogniser 
* visualisers for dependency trees and NER
* word vectors
* extensions

In the second part we discuss
* pretraining,
* training of a TextCategorizer. 

The training and testing data used here is derived from [Medium tags dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/harrisonjansma/medium-stories) published on Kaggle. 

Questions, comments are suggestions are welcome!
